This is the procedure for generating a new Dafny release.

1) In an up-to-date repository, with the master branch checked out,
   cd to the repo root (i.e., dafny, which contains Source, Binaries, etc.)

2) Select a version number (descriptor) $VER

3) Run "package.py $VER" (in a Linux or Mac system)
   Warnings about missing pdb files can be ignored.

4) Create a new release: On 'https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/releases'
   click 'Draft a new release'

5) Fill in a tag ('v' followed by release name), the release name,
the release notes.

6) Add all the .zip files created by step 3 in the Package folder.

7) Commit and push the new version of DafnyRef.pdf (this version is also
   included in the releasae .zip files)

8) Publish the release (by clicking the button at the bottom of the page)
   and announce it to the world.
