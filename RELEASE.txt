This is the procedure for generating a new Dafny release.

0) Write release notes about changes since the last release.

1) In an up-to-date repository, with the master branch checked out,
   cd to the repo root (i.e., dafny, which contains Source, Binaries, etc.)

2) Select a version number (descriptor) $VER (e.g., "3.0.0-alpha")
   Edit it into Source/version.cs
   Commit and merge this change into the master branch

3) Run 'package.py "$VER"' (in a Linux or Mac system)
   Warnings about missing pdb files can be ignored.

4) Commit and push the new version of DafnyRef.pdf and possibly Options.txt
   (.../dafny/docs/DafnyRef/out/DafnyRef.pdf .../dafny/docs/_includes/Options.txt)
   This version of DafnyRef.pdf is also included in the release zip files.

5) Create a new release: On 'https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/releases'
   click 'Draft a new release'

6) Fill in a tag ('v' followed by release name), the release name,
the release notes. For example:
   release descriptor: 3.0.0-alpha
   release tag:        v3.0.0-alpha
   release name:       Dafny 3.0.0 alpha

7) Add all the .zip files created by step 3 in the Package folder.

8) Publish the release (by clicking the button at the bottom of the page)
   and announce it to the world.
