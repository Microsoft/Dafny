This is the procedure for generating a new Dafny release.

0) Write release notes about changes since the last release.

1) In an up-to-date repository, with the master branch checked out,
   cd to the repo root (i.e., dafny, which contains Source, Binaries, etc.)

2) Select a version number (descriptor) $VER (e.g., "3.0.0-alpha")
   Edit it into Source/version.cs
   Commit and merge this change into the master branch

3) Run 'package.py "$VER"' (in a Linux or Mac system)
   Warnings about missing pdb files can be ignored.

4) Commit and push the new version of DafnyRef.pdf and possibly Options.txt
   (.../dafny/docs/DafnyRef/out/DafnyRef.pdf .../dafny/docs/_includes/Options.txt)
   This version of DafnyRef.pdf is also included in the release zip files.

5) Create a new release: On 'https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/releases'
   click 'Draft a new release'

6) Fill in a tag ('v' followed by release name), the release name,
the release notes. For example:
   release descriptor: 3.0.0-alpha
   release tag:        v3.0.0-alpha
   release name:       Dafny 3.0.0 alpha

7) Add all the .zip files created by step 3 in the Package folder.

8) Publish the release (by clicking the button at the bottom of the page)

9) Update the brew formula for dafny (see below)

10) Announce the new release to the world.


--------------------------

brew is a package manager for the Mac.
The dafny project maintains a brew "formula" that allows easy installation of dafny and
its dependencies on a Mac. Note that brew does all installations by building from source.
These are the instructions for updating the formula, which must be done each time
a new release is issued.

These instructions are meant to be executed on a Mac, in a Terminal shell.
All the homebrew formulas are held in a github repo, so some familiarity with git
commands and concepts is helpful.

0) Install brew if it is not already present on your machine:
   'which brew' will tell you if it is
   cf. https://docs.brew.sh/Installation

1) Update brew: brew update

2) Find the formula: cd $(brew --repo)/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core/Formula

3) Prep the repo:
   a) git checkout master
   b) git pull origin
   c) git checkout -b <some new branch name>
      The branch name is needed in various places below

4) Edit it, e.g.: vi dafny.rb
   For a normal release change, all that is needed is to change the name of the
   release and its sha and the revision number.
   a) Change the line near the top of the file that is like
      url "https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/archive/v2.3.0.tar.gz"
      to hold the actual release number (this is the url for the source asset; you
      can see the actual name on the Releases page for the latest build)
   b) Save the file
   c) Run "brew reinstall dafny"
   d) The command will complain that the sha does not match. Copy the correct sha,
      reopen the file and paste the new sha into the "sha" line after the "url" line
   e) Bump up the revision number (by one) on the succeeding line.
   f) Save the file
   g) Check that you have not introduced any syntax errors by running "brew reinstall dafny"
      again. If you totally mess up the file, you can do 'git checkout dafny.rb'

5) Submit the change:
   a) git add dafny.rb (presuming you are still in the directory from step 2)
   b) git commit -m "dafny: <some suitable comment>"
   c) git push https://github.com/<your github username>/homebrew-core/ <the branch name>
      you may be asked to do an 'unshallow' clone -- if so, just execute the given command

6) Expect comments from the brew reviewers. In which case, do 4-6 again.
   Eventually the reviewers will accept and merge the PR

7) Then do
   git checkout master
   git pull origin master

8) Test the installation by running
   brew reinstall dafny
   and then execute dafny on a sample file to see if it has the correct version number
   Even better is to try this step on a different machine than the one on which the
   dafny.rb file was edited

9) If everything works you can, at your leisure do
   git branch -d <the branch name>
